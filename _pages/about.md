Hello! I am Dou Heng but my friends call me Edmund

I'm an undergraduate studying computer science. I'm interested in app development, systems security and embedded electronics. Through these different lenses, they motivate me in understanding how these can impact our everyday lives. In between my commitments, I read anything from up-and-coming technologies to classical humanities. 

After work gets done, I may be found practicing music or running marathons.
