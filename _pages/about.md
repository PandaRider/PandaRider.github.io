Hello! I am Dou Heng but my friends call me Edmund

I'm an undergraduate studying computer science. I'm interested in app development, systems security and embedded electronics. I keep a blog to share some cool stuffs I've learnt. In between my commitments, I read anything from up-and-coming technologies to old-fashioned humanities. Get in touch with me at [edmund_pang@mymail.sutd.edu.sg](edmund_pang@mymail.sutd.edu.sg)

After work gets done, I may be found practicing music or running marathons.
