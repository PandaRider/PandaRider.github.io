The Button is an Augmented and Alternative Communication (AAC) device that empowers non-verbal students to convey information and express emotions. It has two modes: Record allows the user to speak into the device and record a short message; Playback replays the message most recently recorded. A key requirement of the project is to restrict to usage of cheaper components thereby offering a cheaper alternative to similar products [currently in the market](https://www.ablenetinc.com/bigmack).

The project is a collaborative effort of various stakeholders including students, special needs teachers/therapists and caregivers.
