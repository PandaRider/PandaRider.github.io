Ep.1: A Good Walk Spoiled
------

Frequency of golf visits by CEOs of top publicly held companies
> What you’re seeing on average is I think 15 rounds a year is kind of the, the average CEO is playing that amount of golf. Uh, but it’s a heavily skewed distribution, right, so we have a lot people that are playing very little golf. And then we have a tail where we’re picking it up, you know, the top quartile is what we’re looking at, which is 22 or more rounds per year.

Why golf is bad
> And if you go to the top 10% of Biggerstaff’s sample, the CEOs are playing a round at least 37 times a year. A round of golf is a good 4, 4.5 hours, so if you play 37 times a year, that’s more than 160 hours on the course, the equivalent of 5.5 weeks of work.

> Biggerstaff then goes on to show that the more golf a CEO plays, the worse his firm does and also that the more golf a CEO plays, the more likely he is to be fired. In other words, this isn’t a harmless habit; it’s a dangerous habit. 

How California lets the rich gets exemptions from "golf tax"
> So there’s a principle in property tax law called highest and best use, which is that one of the ways you figure out how much to tax a piece of property is to estimate what its best use might be. For example, if I have a one acre plot in the fanciest part of Manhattan that I use to grow vegetables, I can’t say to the city, “That land is worthless. It’s just a vegetable garden.” No. The city is going to say, “We’re going to value that one acre and tax it as if it had an apartment block on it because that’s the best use of land in the fancy parts of Manhattan.” Now, if you’ve got a vast golf course in the middle of Beverly Hills or Brentwood, highest and best use makes you really nervous because plainly, the highest and best use of land in the middle of one of the most expensive and densely populated cities in the world is not a private golf course.

> So years ago, in 1960, California’s country clubs realized they have to act or they’re going to get taxed into oblivion. They get together and they propose an amendment to the state constitution that permanently exempts them from the highest and best use standard. They want their vegetable garden to be taxed as a vegetable garden. If you think about it, this is seriously audacious. Private golf courses are these massive, opulent, gated playgrounds and membership is often restricted. In Los Angeles, in 1960, a lot of these clubs didn’t let in Jews. They certainly didn’t let in black people except to work in the kitchen. Yet they wanted a constitutional exemption to ordinary property taxes like they were some kind of public amenity. How can they argue this?

Defining the Ship of Theseus
> The thing I can’t remember is the ship of Theseus, the famous thought experiment described by the Greek philosopher Plutarch roughly 2000 years ago. Plutarch says imagine Theseus is sailing on a ship and, one by one, he replaces every one of the original planks that make up that ship with a new plank until every single piece of the ship is new. The question is, when Theseus reaches shore, is he sailing on the same ship as he was when he left or a new ship? One view says it’s a new ship. This is called the Mereological Theory of Identity. The identity of something is the sum of its component parts; change the parts, you change the thing. On the other side of the argument is something called Spatiotemporal Continuity Theory, which says that an object can maintain its identity so long as the change is gradual and the form or shape of the object is preserved to the changes of its component materials. I think you can see where I’m going with this.

The pro-spatiotemporal continuity argument
> The idea that what makes the, the ship persist through time is one and the same, is that it moves smoothly through space-time. One plank is removed and thrown overboard and a replacement plank is installed, taken from the cargo the ship has on board. So when it arrives, it doesn’t have a single part that is identical to any of the parts it started out with and so there’s no point at which you can say, “Aha! Now we have a new ship. A different, a numerically different ship.” 

The pro-Mereological Theory of Identity argument
> The museum example goes like this: Suppose the ship is, is in a museum of ancient ships and a gang of crooks is trying to steal this ancient ship and it realizes it can’t just haul it out in one piece; they would easily be spotted. So they come up with a clever scheme.

> They sneak in every night and steal the ship one board at a time, one plank a day, so the museum doesn’t realize what’s going on.

> By the time they’re finished, on day number N, they have all N parts of the ship removed. Now they reassemble them and put it on the black market. They’re selling Theseus’ ancient ship for a pretty price and they’ve left a replica behind in the museum. I contend that, in this case, when you describe it in this way, it seems as if Theseus’ ship has been stolen piecemeal from the museum.

A fairer golf?
> I think someone needs to tell Brentwood and LA Country Club and all the others that if they want to hold spatiotemporal continuity privileges, they have to give something back. Take down your barbed wire. Your members can play golf on weekdays, but evenings and week-ends belong to the ordinary taxpayers of Los Angeles. Let them come and enjoy the greens and fairways that they’ve been subsidizing for generations.

Ep.2: The Road to Damascus
------

On checking the power of CIA
> Why do we put up with a hugely powerful agency like the CIA, with a budget in the tens of billions, doing things we know very little about? Because we’re confident that if the CIA does something truly evil or stupid, the press will find out and let us know.

> What does the CIA look like in the absence of a free press? It looks like the KGB. We have a uniquely American problem here, Malcolm. We’re trying to run a secret intelligence service in an open democratic society. The Russians don’t do that, the Chinese don’t do that, not even the British do that. We need to have a constant tug of war between a free press, a cantankerous press, a skeptical press and the powerful institutions of our government. But there are gonna be arguments.

On reparation 
> ... as if the central fact about Al Pacino was his past associations, “his brutal resume,” as Weiner put it. A resume is a list of accomplishments, but Al Pacino did not consider his past record an accomplishment; he wanted to repudiate it. That was the whole point of him walking into an embassy and offering us everything he knew. Remember what Rizzo said about why Al Pacino did not want money? He said he was doing this for his conscience. It was an act of expiation. Expiation is the act of making amends or reparation for guilt or wrongdoing, atonement. He asked for atonement, we pretended to give it to him, then we took it away. What’s wrong with us?

Ep.3: Miss Buchanan's Period of Adjustment
------

The Supreme Court's mistake in Brown V Board of Education... 
> Now listen to the argument the Supreme Court makes in the Brown decision. They agree that the Browns ought to be able to send Linda to Sumner, but their reasoning is different. I’m quoting, “Segregation of White and Colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the Colored children.” The court’s conclusion was that segregation was de facto unequal. That simply the act of educating Black children separately from White children caused harm, serious harm. The court goes on, “Segregation with the sanction of law has a tendency to retard the educational and mental development of Negro children.” This was light years away from Leola Brown’s position. Leola Brown said that Black run schools like Monroe were good schools, but as a matter principle, she ought to be able to enroll Linda at Sumner. The court said, “Actually, Monroe is not a good school at all. It can’t be a good school because segregation makes it inherently inferior.” Leola Brown said, “We’re fine, we just want some control over our lives.” The court said, “You’re not fine at all. Your educational and mental development has been retarded by your inferior schooling.”

> Now, the court could have said something much more straight forward. How about this? “Schools are where people make the connections that allow them to get ahead in the world. You cannot lock Black people out of the place where social power and opportunity reside.” That argument would have done the job, right? But the court doesn’t say that. In order to condemn the discrimination of Brown’s face, the court instead makes the case that Black people are psychologically crippled.

On racism in America. "Psychological damage"
> The historian Darrell Scott wrote a brilliant book a while back, called Contempt and Pity, in which he points out that there’s been a long history behind this talk of psychological damage. It goes back to the days of slavery. It’s always been incredibly useful for White people to explain the problems of Black people as the result of something personal, internal. It makes their problems their fault.

On the power of teachers
> Now does this mean that White teachers are diabolical racist trying to hold down Black students? No, this isn’t conscious discrimination. The point is that teachers have power, they’re gatekeepers, they control the classroom, they decide who gets recommended for prizes like gifted programs and who doesn’t, they decide who stays and who gets suspended. By directing their attention to a child, a teacher can inspire. By ignoring another or sending him more often the principal’s office, teachers can discourage.

Ep.4: The Foot Soldier of Birmingham
------

On fairy tales
> Euphemism and evasion. At the beginning, I said that what I object to is the way so many stories about race get cleaned up, sanitized. So the Brown decision becomes a fairy tale in which Black people triumph without effort. Well, here’s the flip side. When we stop evading and just listen, it gets complicated. Our hero Walter Gadsden isn’t all that heroic. As for the bad guy, the officer, his colleague Bobby Hayes says he wasn’t a bad guy. Did Officer Hayes tell me things that surprised me? And did listening to Walter Gadsden shock me? Absolutely, because I’m no different from anyone else; I like the fairy tale.

Ep.5: The Prime Minister and the Prof
------

> ... we don’t just store information in our minds or in specific places, we store memories and understanding in the minds of the people we love... That’s transactive memory; little bits of ourselves reside in other people’s minds.

> One time in parliament, another MP criticizes Lindemann and Churchill goes crazy. He says, “Love Me, love my dog. And if you don’t love my dog, you damn well can’t love me,” and that’s high praise. Because remember, to an Englishman of that generation, the only living creature you’re allowed to show affection for is your dog.

On "court politics"
> We go through lengthy election seasons where we endlessly scrutinize all the people running for public office. We look at the candidates, their beliefs, their background, the clothes they wear, we look at them. But then, after the election is over, we realize we didn’t just elect that candidate because no one governs alone. Eventually, leaders get overwhelmed. At a certain point, they’re gonna call their closest friend at 2:00 in the morning and say, “What do I do?” So when you’re voting for someone, you’re also voting for that friend who gets called at 2:00 in the morning. That’s what’s strange about elections; friends should be scrutinized. The friends should all have to debate each other, but they don’t. Friends get a pass.

Ep.6: The King of Tears
------

Why certain country songs are more popular than others.
> That’s how you get tears. You make the story so real and the details so sharp and you add in so many emotional triggers that the listener cannot escape. But it’s a risky thing to do, right? If you aren’t a talented composer and you don’t do a sensitive rendition of those lyrics, they could fall flat. It can seem forced, even offensive. Far easier just to fall back on the bland cliché that Wild Horses couldn’t drag you away... Country music makes people cry because it’s not afraid to be specific.

Ep.7: State v Johnson
------

On power
> In the course of this season, I have been preoccupied with the subject of power, the particular power of friendship, the way shifts in power change the way we remember the past. And with this episode and the next one, I want to return to that subject one more time and focus on our reluctance to acknowledge the role of power, the way we pretend that we can make sense of the world without first clarifying who has the power and who does not.

> Everyone went on with their lives, the judges, the Attorney General, the lawyers. It takes time to unravel the truth in situations where one side has all the power; nobody had the time.

Ep.8: Mr Hollowell didn't like that
------

Winning minds and hearts
> In the evening, Carter says he would walk through the Black neighborhoods and hear people reenacting the trial in barber shops and beauty parlors. In other words, there were two conversations going on at any given time. There was the legal conversation, witness, judge lawyers, accused. If you were a White lawyer dealing with a White world, that was the conversation you worried about. But there was a second conversation which was between the Black lawyers and the people in the balcony and if you were an underdog with a limited chance to win at the first conversation, then that second conversation was really important. Donald Hollowell was very good at the first conversation, the legal one; he was a master of the second.

On the system (of racism in America)
> It’s not as if the whole group of them, the victim, the police officer, the witness, the doctor, the press got in a room and worked out an elaborate story to tell the court. That would be a conspiracy, but you only need a conspiracy where there is a system to conspire against. There was no system to conspire against. They were the system. 

On the cyclic nature of civil rights movements
> Things got worse for the civil rights movement before they got better. The Willie Nash case was in 1954, the same year that the Supreme Court ruled in the Brown V. Board of Education decision that racial segregation was unconstitutional. After Brown came what is known in civil rights history as massive resistance. The White political power structure of the south rose up and the backlash began. One by one, White governors and mayors and senators, who had been at least moderate on racial issues, were replaced by hardline racists. 

> The decade leading up to the 1964 Civil Rights Act was a dark time in American racial history. We forget this now. Martin Luther King led the Montgomery bus boycott in 1956, but after that, he had years in the wilderness when even members of his own community had turned against him. And in October of 1960, at the lowest ebb, King gets arrested. He was already on probation for a traffic violation.

> That (the transfer to a particularly notorious state prison) was the worst night of Martin Luther King’s life. 

On perseverance
> But more than that, because I wanted to understand what it means to persevere. It’s not just that the stories are shocking and extraordinary; it’s the sheer weight of them. A White woman has her boyfriend murdered and then just randomly pins it on a Black man who just happens to be in the neighborhood. A police officer shoots a teenager in the back and gets off scot free. A kid gets arrested, arraigned, indicted, tried, convicted, and sentenced to die before he can even mount a defense. Your leader gets whisked away to a chain gang because he didn’t get his license change within 90 days. You fight an uphill battle all morning in the courtroom, then you eat bologna sandwich in your car like a fugitive and it never ends. You get in the car and you drive to one end of the state and the judge swivels in his chair and will not offer you the basic courtesy of facing you as you speak. Then, you sleep two in a bed, in a stranger’s house and do it all again the next day and the next day. I don’t understand how Donald Hollowell did it and maybe more importantly, I don’t understand how we kept everyone else, the people behind him who didn’t have his strength, from giving up.

Ep.9: 
------

McDonald's success: Fries
> Now, why is Ray Kroc so smitten with McDonald’s? Not because of the burger. The burger is fine, but it’s not any different from burgers anywhere else. It’s because of the fries. Ray Kroc can’t believe how good they are, golden brown, crispy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside. Let me quote to you from Kroc’s autobiography, the crucial passage, “To most people, a French fried potato is a pretty uninspiring object. It’s fodder, something to kill time chewing between bites of hamburger and swallows of milkshake. That’s your ordinary French fry. The McDonald’s French fry was in an entirely different league; they lavished attention on it. I didn’t know it then, but one day I would too. The French fry would become almost sacrosanct to me, its preparation a ritual to be followed religiously.” 

Ep. 10: The Basement Tapes
------

On epidemiological studies: Mediterranean diet
> There are lots of ways to analyze the effect that diet has on health. You can do an observational study, for example. Identify tens of thousands of people, have them fill out a questionnaire on their diet at regular intervals over many years, then keep track of when they die and what they die of and look for patterns. That’s what an epidemiological study is. Frantz had a colleague at the University of Minnesota, named Ancel Keys, who conducted maybe the most famous epidemiological study of diet and health in history. For 25 years, Keys collected data on about 12,000 middle age men in Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia, Finland, the Netherlands, Japan, and the United States. And he came to the conclusion that the people eating what he called “a Mediterranean diet,” lots of fish, vegetables, olive oil, and very little saturated fat, those people had the fewest heart attacks. Keys was massively influential.

The problem with epidemiological studies: Sugar
> The problem is epidemiological studies are really tricky. For example, in France, people eat lots of butter and cheese and things cooked in fat, yet they have really low rates of heart disease. France was not included in the seven country study. Would Ancel Keys’ results have been different if he’d added France and done an eight country study? With epidemiological studies, you can get in real trouble if you pick the wrong populations. And how does Keys know that’s all the olive oil and fish and vegetables of the Mediterranean diet that make people from those places live so long? He’s noticed an association between that diet and good health, but an epidemiological study can’t prove causation. Many years later, another researcher went back and reanalyzed Keys’ data and showed that people’s consumption of sugar was a much better predictor of their health than their consumption of saturated fat.

A better method: controlled clinical trials
> The only way around these problems is to do a controlled clinical trial, a study where you gather together two large groups of people who you think are identical on every variable you can imagine — age, weight, lifestyle, social class. Have one group eat their normal diet and have the other eat something you think is way healthier and then follow them for years and see what happens. 

On principles above beliefs: humility
> Ivan Frantz had a set of beliefs, opinions. He thought you’d live longer if you lowered your cholesterol. He thought that a healthy diet was one rich in vegetable oils and low in saturated fats. He believed in margarine and not butter. Those were the beliefs that drove his research agenda, but what Robert Frantz is talking about when he says, “My father was a humble man,” is something far more crucial than belief. He’s talking about his father’s principles, the foundation of his father’s thinking. Ivan Frantz’s foundational principle was humility. He was fully prepared to accept, at any given moment, that his beliefs might not be right and that he might not know the answer.
