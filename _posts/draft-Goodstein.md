I think what struck me, besides the weight of the words of such a high ranking academic at an extremely elite university (caltech), is that this was written more than 2 decades ago. Recently, there was a paper that mostly validated his beliefs: 

<!-- As always, I don't believe in sweeping statements like Science is hitting a wall. Personally, I think each each discipline have their own half-life. A few disciplines may have truly hit a wall (e.g. maths or classical mechanics, any paper that will appear on Nature is probably on P=NP or propulsion). Or they may be waiting for a new breakthrough but in the mean time remain relatively stagnant (psychology waiting for biology to map the human brain). Or their exponential growth is still very very early (e.g. cosmology's gravitational fields or quantum mechanics). As for my discipline... People are still arguing what is the "science" in "computer science"? Afterall, whatever we invent/discover isn't natural.  -->

Goodstein's stance: 
> But the growth of the profession of science, the scientific enterprise, is bound to reach certain limits. I contend that these limits have now been reached.

Why the current system of Ph.D => professorships is flawed
> If American science were in a steady state condition, the average professor in a research university would need to produce only one future research professor for the next gen- eration. Instead, the average professor, in the course of a typical 30-year career, turns out about 15 students with doctorates - and most such people want to be research professors. As the growth of science slowed in recent decades, it did not take long for the smarter students to realize that not everyone with a Ph.D. could become a research professor.
