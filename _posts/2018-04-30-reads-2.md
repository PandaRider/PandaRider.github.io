Expression Meets Information
------

expression:
> Of course, human communication is as much about social
interaction as it is about conveying information. The quantity
of information or the accuracy with which it is transmitted is
often less significant than its qualities; *what* is said is often less
important than *how* it is said.

tension 1: nine ways to say yes
> The meaning of the simplest utterances depends as much
on tone of voice as the choice of words. The word yes can be
delivered as a positive, affirmative response to a question, but
said differently, it can express detachment, sarcasm, disbelief,
or tentativeness instead, undermining the questioner rather
than agreeing with or reassuring them. Linguist David Crystal
has illustrated this with intonation diagrams of nine different
ways of responding “yes” in English to the same question,
but he says that “no one has yet described all of the nuances
of meaning that can be conveyed by the intonation system. 
Nine ways is nowhere near the richness of expression that
most speakers employ. 

> In contrast, users of current communication aids have little
or no control over intonation. Most systems are based on text-to-speech technology.
