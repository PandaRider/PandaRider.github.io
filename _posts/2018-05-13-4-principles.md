I don't usually read books that gloss over high-level concepts. I prefer books that give deep insights. Effectively, *Principles* is a big-book-of-you-dont-say. But it does not mean that it's useless. To me, I find it useful as it kinda summarizes many things I learnt and forgotten over the years. 

> To be principled means to consistently operate with principles that can be clearly explained.

I'm also quite pleasantly surprised by the circumstances that made me to read this book.

Part II: Life Principles
------

### 1. Embrace Reality and Deal with It

On life choices and our limited time/effort. (1.1)
> The question isn’t just how much of each ("Savor Life" vs "Make An Impact") to go after, but how hard to work to get as much as possible. 
<!-- I wanted crazy amounts of each, was thrilled to work hard to get as much of them as possible, and found that they could largely be one and the same and mutually reinforcing. Over time I learned that getting more out of life wasn’t just a matter of working harder at it. It was much more a matter of working effectively, because working effectively could increase my capacity by hundreds of times. I don’t care what you want or how hard you want to work for it. That’s for you to decide. I’m just trying to pass along to you what has helped me get the most out of each hour of time and each unit of effort. -->

On being radically open-minded and radically transparent (1.3)
> It's natural to fear (being radically open-minded and radically transparent)... Besides giving me the freedom to be me, it has allowed me to understand others and for them to understand me... I’m not talking about everyone’s very personal inner secrets; I’m talking about people’s opinions of each other and of how the world works.

On how reality works and how to understand it (1.4)
> This struggle (in humans, higher-level thinking like abstraction and logic versus animalistic thinking like emotions and instinct) causes people to confuse what they want to be true with what actually is true.

> In fact, to understand the world accurately you need both (top down and bottom up perspectives)

> So I start from the premise that nature is smarter than I am and try to let nature teach me how reality works.

> Evolve or die. The key is to fail, learn, and improve quickly.

On evolution being reality's natural order (1.5)
> One of the great marvels of nature is how the whole system, which is full of individual organisms acting in their own self-interest and without understanding or guiding what’s going on, can create a beautifully operating and evolving whole.

> Reality is optimizing for the whole - not for you. Contribute to the whole and you will likely be rewarded.

> Realize that you are simultaneously everything and nothing—and decide what you want to be... The question is how we matter and evolve. 

On law of diminishing returns (1.6)
> Once we get the things we are striving for, we rarely remain satisfied with them. The things are just the bait. Chasing after them forces us to evolve, and it is the evolution and not the rewards themselves that matters to us and to those around us. This means that for most people success is struggling and evolving as effectively as possible... It is natural that it should be this way because of the law of diminishing returns. 

**Pain + Reflection = Progress** (1.7)
> Most people have a tough time reflecting when they are in pain and they pay attention to other things when the pain passes, so they miss out on the reflections that provide the lessons.

The 4 options when you encounter your weaknesses. (1.10)
> The worst path you can take is the first. Denial can only lead to your constantly banging up against your weaknesses, having pain, and not getting anywhere. The second—accepting your weaknesses while trying to turn them into strengths—is probably the best path if it works. But some things you will never be good at and it takes a lot of time and effort to change. The best single clue as to whether you should go down this path is whether the thing you are trying to do is consistent with your nature (i.e., your natural abilities). The third path—accepting your weaknesses while trying to find ways around them—is the easiest and typically the most viable path, yet it is the one least followed. The fourth path, changing what you are going after, is also a great path, though it requires flexibility on your part to get past your preconceptions and enjoy the good fit when you find it.

### 2. Use the 5-Step Process to Get What You Want Out of Life

Have clear goals (2.1)
> Prioritize... Don't confuse goals with desires. Typically, desires are first-order consequences. For example, your goal might be physical fitness, while your desire is to eat good-tasting but unhealthy food.

> What you think is attainable is just a function of what you know at the moment.

> Almost nothing can stop you from succeeding if you have a) flexibility and b) self-accountability.

Identify and don't tolerate problems (2.2)
> Acknowledging your weaknesses is not the same as surrendering to them. It’s the first step toward overcoming them.

Diagnose problems to get at their root causes (2.3)
> Focus on the “what is” before deciding “what to do about it.

> Distinguish proximate causes from root causes. Proximate causes are typically the actions (or lack of actions) that lead to problems, so they are described with verbs (I missed the train because I didn’t check the train schedule). Root causes run much deeper and they are typically described with adjectives (I didn’t check the train schedule because I am forgetful).

Design a plan (2.4)
> You should go from the big picture and drill down to specific tasks and estimated time lines (e.g., “In the next two weeks, choose the headhunters who will find those great people”). The real-world issues of costs, time, and personnel will undoubtedly surface as you do this, and that will lead you to further refine your design until all the gears in the machine are meshing smoothly.

> Write down your plan for everyone to see and to measure your progress against. This includes all the granular details about who needs to do what tasks and when. The tasks, the narrative, and the goals are different, so don’t mix them up. Remember, the tasks are what connect the narrative to your goals.

Push through to completion (2.5)
> You need to push through and that requires self-discpline to follow your script... When you feel yourself losing sight of that, stop and ask yourself “why?” Lose sight of the why and you will surely lose sight of your goals.

### 3. Be Radically Open-Minded

> Closed-minded people say things like “I could be wrong... but here’s my opinion.” This is a classic cue I hear all the time. It’s often a perfunctory gesture that allows people to hold their own opinion while convincing themselves that they are being open-minded. If your statement starts with “I could be wrong” or “I’m not believable,” you should probably follow it with a question and not an assertion.
Open-minded people know when to make statements and when to ask questions.

### 4. Understand That People Are Wired Very Differently

Why our attributes are a double-edged sword
> For example, a highly creative, goal-oriented person good at imagining new ideas might undervalue the minutiae of daily life, which is also important; he might be so driven in his pursuit of long-term goals that he might have disdain for people who focus on the details of daily life. Similarly, a task-oriented person who is great with details might undervalue creativity—and worse still, may squelch it in the interests of efficiency. These two people might make a great team, but are likely to have trouble taking advantage of the ways they’re complementary, interests of efficiency... the ways their minds work make it difficult for them to see the value of each other’s ways of thinking.

On brain elasticity
> This brings us to an important question: Can we change? We can all learn new facts and skills, but can we also learn to change how we are inclined to think? The answer is a qualified **yes**.

### 5. Learn How to Make Decisions Effectively

> Recognize that 1) the biggest threat to good decision making is harmful emotions, and 2) decision is a two-step process; first learning and then deciding.

On synthesizing bigger-picture view and microscopic details
> The key is having the higher-level perspective to make fast and accurate judgments on what the real risks are without getting bogged down in details. 

On synthesizing through time
> When determining an acceptable rate of improvement for something, it is its level in relation to the rate of change that matters.

> Remember the **80/20 Rule** and know what the key 20 percent is.

On using probability
> The best choices are the ones that have more pros than cons, not those that don't have any cons at all.

On prioritizing
> **Don't mistake possibilities for probabilities.**
