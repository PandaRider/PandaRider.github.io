### Introduction
I'm a Singaporean Chinese but my Chinese was terrible. 2 years ago, I started to relearn it and never expected that the process of relearning my mother tongue has brought me so much joy that I wish I started it sooner! I started relearning in 2018; my 3rd year in university. 2 years later… My Chinese reading/writing has vastly improved but my speaking is still somewhat clunky.

## Why I am re-learning Chinese? 
### Cultural 
There are 3 sub-reasons. First and most importantly, I don’t want the day when my future child ask me how to read a Chinese newspaper article and I have to tell him to use Google Translate. I had that privilege from my father. Secondly and somewhat related, talking in Chinese is also now being used to connect with him. The last sub-reason is that I'm learning basic German and it will be weird if my German is better than Chinese (I've since realised it's not possible).

### Economic-ish

I had a [“Teachable Moment”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teachable_moment) where I wished I had good Chinese. I needed to buy some electronics from TaoBao and I had to chat with suppliers through AliWangWang. Half the time I was using Google Translate. There were many cool stuffs that I didn't know was possible like buying custom print tote bags by sending the seller an image. 

For the record, I'm not learning Chinese because “China is a rising economy, you're missing out if you don't speak it”. I don't forsee myself using Chinese professionally. To use an analogy, my burning desire to master Chinese is fueled by this TaoBao incident as the initial tinder and sustained by cultural reasons as mentioned above.

### Curiosity

I re-discovered Anki, the spaced-repetition software tool (check out my article on why you should use it). Chinese is notoriously hard for English speakers but for me, the language isn’t the problem… The problem for me was my false belief that “I'm not a language person”. Language learning was Anki's original purpose anyway. Anki was the spark of fire that lit the tinder.

## How to improve Chinese as an adult-learner
  1. **Use Anki.** As a working adult with commitments, time is a valuable resource. I spend about 15-30 minutes almost always on commute to practice my Chinese. 
  2. **Enjoy Chinese.** Once I began to see some results, it is easier to appreciate Chinese. Let me be clear: Using Anki first is the cause (yes, it will be painful the first few weeks), enjoying chinese is it's effect. Especially so when using idioms with/at your friends.
  3. **Change language settings** to Chinese. 
  4. **Watch videos**. I recommend Hear U Out or Unexpectedness
  5. **Talking** to friends in Chinese. I got to admit, my chinese is still clunky. 

## Rants:
### Learning how to write Chinese
   While my goal is to read Chinese, after 6 months did I realise that writing and reading are two sides of the same coin. Writing Chinese is hard and though I've seen my native Chinese friends struggle to write some common words... It is absolutely necessary.
### LianheZaobao Chinese standard is close to China's
   This is verified by my Chinese friends. As if using Chinese specific names that has no phonetic relation to the English names (e.g. Clementi = 金文泰）isn't hard enough... There are also condensed words and words that are not used in daily speech (e.g. passed on = 撒手人寰 *let go of this mortal world*).
   
### Language quirks
Every language has it's rules and exceptions, and Chinese is no exception... 
- One pronunciation, many possible written forms. 摆tuò = 拖/拓/妥/脱/托? 
- One stroke, different words. 萦绕 vs 探索。潇洒 vs 酒
- Length of stroke, different words. 末 vs 未。曰 vs 日

## Unexpected Joys
### Expressiveness
I think I'm starting to understand why people love languages! Chinese is more expressive than English thanks to how strongly intertwined idioms are. Also, the history of languages is interesting! For example, both Chinese and English language define pregnancy as something related to farming and productivity (English calls pregnancy as “labor”. Chinese calls it as 生产). 

Did you know that a phone's keyboard sometimes prompts special emojis as you type? (e.g. haha => (∩_∩))

### Connecting with my father
As an adult, maybe it's work or different interests that family relationships isn't as tight as it was. Chinese became the common interest that my father and I have. Friends often ask why I don't read news from my phone (the digital form's biggest advantage is smart word detection and quick translation); the reason is I can ask my father. He's Chinese educated so he can effortlessly read Chinese newspaper and explain to me certain stuffs/contexts.

### Learning from friends
Thank you BaoYi, Hans, JiangFeng, JiaWei, Kevin, ShaoFeng. For introducing me to your funniest videos to teaching me new words... but really its your encouragement and enthusiasm in all things Chinese. 

## What's next
This blog post is just a checkpoint. Anki can only bring me so far. I'm still watching as many videos as time allows. The next step is to hire a teacher or go to China and immerse in it's culture. If you have any interesting video recommendations *in chinese*, please share them with me!

### 简况
<!-- ### 引言/简介/简况/序言 -->
我是一个新加坡华人可是从小到大我的中文很烂。两年前（大三时）我开始从学中文而我万万没想到学习的过程会带给我这么多欢乐！两年后。。。我的读写能力大大了进步可是我的讲话能力有待进步。

## 学习华文的理由
### 文化素质
文化理由有三个部分。一，我不想有一天我的未来孩子问我咋么样读报纸文章而我叫他用谷歌翻译。我小时候有父亲能解释给我文章的意识是我的福气。二，也是相关的理由，能够讲流利的华语使得我和我爸更容易沟通和联系。三，我在学基本德语，若我的德语比华语好感觉不当（我最近发现这是不大可能的）

### 小小经济

<figure class="half">

  <figcaption>讲华语，我勉强可以。</figcaption>
</figure>

我的书到用时方恨少的时刻是在我从淘宝买一些电子元器件，而我不得不通过阿里旺旺与供应商聊天。我大多数时间在用谷歌翻译。还有别的好处像上传设计给供应商而他们能做定制印花手提袋（比在本地做便宜多了）。

我要清楚的说，我不是学中文应为我要追求中国繁荣的经济机会。我暂时没有打算用中文在工作。举个比喻，如果我渴望掌握中文的愿望是个火，那次淘宝事件是掌握中文的火种，而文化原因是把火不断增强的燃料。

### 好奇心

<figure class="half">

</figure>

我重新发现了间隔重复软件工具Anki（请参阅我的文章，了解使用它的好处）。中文对讲英语的人很难可是问题不在于语言，我本身的问题是一个错误信念：“我不是学语言的料”。反正Anki的原本用处是在于学语文。Anki是点燃火种的火星。

## (成熟人)学习华文的方式
1. **用Anki**。身为成年人，时间是很宝贵。我每天只需花15-30分钟上下班练习中文。
2. **爱中文**。一旦我看到一些结果，我更容易欣赏中文。让我清楚说明：使用Anki先（是的，前几周会很痛苦）会造成你喜欢用中文。尤其是与朋友一起使用成语。
3. **更改语言设置**为中文。
4. **观看视频**。 我推荐：权听你说，万万没想到，
5. **用华语和朋友聊天**。 我承认，我的华语仍然跟流利差蛮远。

## 发牢骚
### 学习写华文。
   我以为既然我的目标只是读华文报纸，没必要学习写华文字。其实学读和写是一个问题的两个方面。虽然我的中国朋友也有遇到一些困难用笔写，多多少少必须写一点。
### 联合早报的华语水准比较接近中国大陆的。
   我跟我的中国朋友确认过。中文有一些特定名称跟英文没有语音关系（例子：金文泰 = Clementi)。。。更惨的是联合早报有很多词都是缩短还是日常用词中不使用（例子：去世 = 撒手人寰）。
### 中文奇特规则
每个语言都有规矩与例外。。。
- 一种说法，很多有可能的写法。
- 一横差别会给不同字。萦绕 vs 探索。潇洒 vs 酒
- 一横的长度会给不同字。末 vs 未。曰 vs 日

## 不想意外的惊喜
### 表达能力
我开始明白为什么有些人喜欢学语言！中文会比英文多表达性应为中文成语包含很多意思。还有，语言的历史很有趣！例如，中文和英文都将怀孕定义为与农业和生产力相关的事物（英文称怀孕为“labor”，中文称为生产）。

不说你不知：手机键盘有时会有时会在您输入时提示特殊表亲符号？（例如：哈哈 =>（∩_∩））

### 改善父子关系
也许是长大工作还是有不同的兴趣，我和我家人没有比以前密切。中文是我和我父亲的共同兴趣。有些朋友问我为什么不在网上读新闻。我不这么做原因是报纸可以跟我父亲聊天的沟通工具。他是受了华校教育，读华文报纸而解释给我难不倒他。

### 从朋友学习
我想要感谢保颐，勤航，将峰，嘉玮，郭先生，少峰。在你们介绍有趣的视屏和叫我新的词汇，我感受到你们的鼓励与热情。

## 下一步
这个博客贴纸只是个检查点。Anki 只能推我到这么远。我能看多少视屏就看多少。下一步就是聘请老师或去中国深深地了解中国文化。如果你有有趣的视频推荐，请分享给我！
