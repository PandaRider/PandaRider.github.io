Working definition of IQ (Linda Gottfredson):
> ... involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems,
think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly
and learn from experience. It is not merely book learning, a
narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather it reflects a
broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings“
catching on,” “making sense” of things, or “figuring out”
what to do.

Note: To be honest, I don't really like this academic definition of IQ. In my opinion, IQ/intelligence is the ability to see patterns that others can't.

Other measures of intelligence besides analytic intelligence/IQ (still debatable and outside the scope of this paper)
> Types of intelligence other than the analytic kind
examined by IQ tests certainly have a reality. Robert Sternberg
and his colleagues (Sternberg, 1999, 2006) have studied
practical intelligence, which they define as the ability
to solve concrete problems in real life that require searching
for information not necessarily contained in a problem
statement, and for which many solutions are possible, as
well as creativity, or the ability to come up with novel
solutions to problems and to originate interesting questions.

Definition of crystallized intelligence:
> ... crystallized intelligence, g(C), or the individual’s
store of knowledge about the nature of the world
and learned operations such as arithmetical ones which can
be drawn on in solving problems.

Definition of fluid intelligence:
> ... fluid intelligence, which is the ability to solve novel problems that
depend relatively little on stored knowledge as well as the
ability to learn.

Nature vs Nurture (Genes vs Environment): 

SES and IQ:
> For families at the lowest levels of SES, shared
environment accounted for almost all of the variation in IQ,
with genes accounting for practically none. As SES increased, the contribution of shared environment diminished
and the contribution of genes increased, crossing in lower
middle-class families. Finally, in the most socioeconomically
advantaged families (who were not wealthy), practically
all of the variation in IQ was accounted for by genes,
and almost none was accounted for by shared environment.
